            <p>Personal Data and data security is not solely dependent on the Company. You should protect the account information in your possession as well. When using our Services you play a vital role in protecting your own personal information. When registering with our Services, it is important to choose a password of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to any third-parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account.</p>
            <p>In the event of a Personal Data breach, the Company shall without undue delay, and where feasible, not later than forty-eight (48) hours after having become aware of it, notify the breach to the competent supervisory authority, unless said breach is unlikely to result in a risk to your rights and freedoms. If the breach is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, the Company shall communicate this breach to you, if it is feasible, without undue delay. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from us by internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS, since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves and until it reaches us. If you have reason to believe that your data is no longer secure, please contact us at “support@wehodler.com”.</p>
